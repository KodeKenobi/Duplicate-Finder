# Duplicate-Finder
A python terminal program that finds and deletes duplicates in folders


#PROBLEM?

Imagine you have a folder that has thousands and thousands of duplicate files and you want to locate them and perhaps delete all of them.

#HOW THE PROGRAM WORKS

By hashing, you can generate a string for every individual file. Each file will have a unique string generated by the hash function.

Uses md5 hashing to return a 32 character hash string.

Stores hash value string in a dictionary along with it's file path and then checks if we are getting any duplicate entries in our dictionary and if we do, we take the file path of that filr and we delete that file.
